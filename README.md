Imbalance between positive and negative outcomes, a so-called class imbalance, is a problem generallyfound  in  medical  data.  Imbalanced  data  hinders  the  performance  of  conventional  classificationmethods  which  aim  to  improve  the  overall  accuracy  of  the  model  without  accounting  for  unevendistribution  of  the  classes.  To  rectify  this,  the  data  can  be  resampled  by  oversampling  the  positive(minority) class until the classes are approximately equally represented. After that a prediction modelsuch as Gradient Boosting algorithm can be fitted with greater confidence. This classification methodallows  for  non-linear  relationships  and  deep  interactive  effects  while  focusing  on  difficult  areas  byiterative shifting towards problematic observations. In this study we demonstrate application of thesemethods  to  medical  data  and  develop  a  practical  framework  for  evaluation  of  features  contributinginto the probability of stroke.
